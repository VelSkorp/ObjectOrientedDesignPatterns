# Object-Oriented Design Patterns in C#

This repository contains examples and explanations of common **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** in C# from [refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog). Each design pattern has been implemented with C# code to illustrate its usage and best practices.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Design Patterns provide solutions to common software design problems. They are reusable solutions that follow best practices in software development, enhancing code flexibility and maintainability. This repository aims to teach and demonstrate the implementation of various design patterns using C#.

## Design Patterns Covered

Below are the design patterns covered in this repository:

### Behavioral Patterns

1. [**Observer Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/BehavioralPatterns/Observer/README.md)
2. [**State Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/BehavioralPatterns/State/README.md)
2. [**Template Method Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/BehavioralPatterns/TemplateMethod/README.md)
2. [**Visitor Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/BehavioralPatterns/Visitor/README.md)

### Creational Patterns

1. [**Abstract Factory Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/CreationalPatterns/AbstractFactory/README.md)
2. [**Singleton Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/CreationalPatterns/Singleton/README.md)

### Structural Patterns

1. [**Composite Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/StructuralPatterns/Composite/README.md)
2. [**Flyweight Pattern**](ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns/StructuralPatterns/Flyweight/README.md)

Each pattern is organized in its own folder with relevant code files and explanation.
